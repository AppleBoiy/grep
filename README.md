[![progress-banner](https://backend.codecrafters.io/progress/grep/330ca142-d9f2-4cd3-aae9-252b09b31336)](https://app.codecrafters.io/users/codecrafters-bot?r=2qF)

This is a starting point for C++ solutions to the
["Build Your Own grep" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/grep/overview).

[Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)
(Regexes, for short) are patterns used to match character combinations in
strings. [`grep`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) is a CLI tool for
searching using Regexes.

In this challenge you'll build your own implementation of `grep`. Along the way
we'll learn about Regex syntax, how parsers/lexers work, and how regular
expressions are evaluated.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.
